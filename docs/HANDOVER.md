# HANDOVER

## 2026-10-12 session (Cowork, planning)
- Plan reviewed and revised to rev 3 (OneDrive project folder).
- PRJNA1181840 ENA run record verified; see PROJECT_STATE.md.
- Next: run bin/00_ena_metadata.sh in WSL, fetch chemistry/basecaller from SRA/paper, audit LomanLab
  accessions, check disk space, then choose the Phase 0 dataset (Decision 1) and fix metrics (Decision 2).
- Rule: update PROJECT_STATE.md and this file before ending any session, in any tool.

## 2026-10-12 session (data access)
- Measured data access; switched to SRA block sampling (see PROJECT_STATE.md, docs/SUBSET_PLAN.md).
- Next: bin/01_sra_block_sample.py --plan-only, then run it in tmux (~1.5 h); then seqkit/NanoPlot checks on both pools;
  confirm chemistry/basecaller; pick Phase 0 dataset (Decision 1) and fix metrics (Decision 2).

## 2026-10-12 end of day (supersedes the earlier "Next:" lines)
State: Phase 0 in progress. Sampling is complete; QC is next.
- Done: plan rev 3 (OneDrive copy); repo scaffold in WSL; ENA run record verified for PRJNA1181840 (SRR31222153);
  data access measured (~0.5 MB/s everywhere, ENA FASTQ is one gzip stream); SRA read-range route verified
  (first 200 reads identical to ENA); bin/01_sra_block_sample.py run to completion (74 blocks, 168.6 min).
- Result: dev and eval pools, each 185,000 reads (~1 Gb), mean length 5,491 / 5,473 bp (run mean 5,479);
  no length drift across the run (-30 bp). Files in data/subsets/, manifest in metadata/. Details: docs/PROJECT_STATE.md.
- Decisions so far: D1 Nextflow (plain scripts first), D2 taxonomy first, D3 one frozen database, D4 memory-capped
  classifier setup (12 GB RAM), D5 dev/eval separation, D6 SRA block sampling, D7 stream scripts removed.
- Not yet checked: read QUALITY distributions and pool similarity; chemistry/basecaller; Zymo D6331 composition.

Next steps, in order:
1. QC both pools (seqkit stats, NanoPlot) in pinned Docker images; compare length and quality between pools.
2. Confirm chemistry/kit and basecaller (SRA experiment SRX26602699 page, or the Argo paper methods); get the
   Zymo D6331 reference composition from the manufacturer spec sheet. Record both in the dataset register.
3. Settle Decision 1 (dataset) and Decision 2 (metrics, detection threshold rule) in PROJECT_STATE.md.
4. Optional: check whether LomanLab data has ENA accessions (second dataset for a chemistry-transfer test).
5. Phase 1: choose the baseline classifier and a database that fits 12 GB RAM; freeze and record it.
6. Only then wrap steps in Nextflow (D1).

Housekeeping:
- GitHub: https://github.com/bkhimek/nanopore-metagenomics-benchmark. Check `git status`; commit and push if not done.
  Still to add: LICENSE, README line "research use only, not clinically validated".
- OneDrive folder: delete setup_project.sh and the stray cd.docx; the plan copy and SUBSET_PLAN.md are snapshots (recopy if changed).
- Rules: update this file and PROJECT_STATE.md before ending any session; verify numbers from primary records, not summaries.
